<sub>*Brazilian Navy Submarine Officer and MSc student in AI</sub>

As a 10-years experienced Navy Submarine Officer I combine analytical skills, ability to lead small teams in adverse conditions, and attention to details. 

I have a Bachelor's degree in Naval Science with an emphasis on weapons systems from the Naval Academy, a postgraduate specialization in Artificial Intelligence and last year I started a Master's degree in Systems and Computer Engineering (research line in Artificial Intelligence) at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

In addition, I've always been used to studying on my own, having taken online courses in programming, Linux, statistics, ML, Data Science and Analytics, as well as digital marketing and copywriting.

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Submarine Operations, digital marketing and copywriting.
